**Sypnosis:**
*Supernatural is a series about brothers Sam and Dean Winchester who travel the United States in their '67 Chevy Impala to hunt supernatural beings like monsters, demons, and ghosts, following in the footsteps of their father. Their family business is "saving people, hunting things" as they navigate a world filled with urban legends, folklore, and a vast mythology involving angels, reapers, and powerful, cosmic entities. The show, which ran for 15 seasons, is a dark fantasy drama that explores faith, family, and the eternal struggle between good and evil.*
